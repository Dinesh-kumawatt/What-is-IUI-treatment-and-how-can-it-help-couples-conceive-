IUI, or Intrauterine Insemination, is one of the most common fertility treatments offered to couples who are trying to conceive but facing mild fertility challenges. It’s a less invasive and more affordable option compared to IVF and is usually considered as the first line of assisted reproduction.

In simple terms, IUI involves placing specially prepared sperm directly into the woman’s uterus around the time of ovulation. The goal is to increase the number of sperm that reach the fallopian tubes and thereby increase the chance of fertilization. It’s often recommended for couples with unexplained infertility, mild male factor infertility, or women who have cervical mucus issues or ovulation problems.

The procedure itself is quick, often painless, and doesn’t require anesthesia. A typical cycle involves monitoring the woman’s ovulation either naturally or with the help of fertility medications. Once ovulation is about to occur, a sperm sample is washed and prepared in a lab, and then injected into the uterus using a thin catheter. After the procedure, normal daily activities can be resumed almost immediately.

At Trinity IVF Ahmedabad, the IUI treatment is carefully designed to give each couple the best chance of success. Their team uses advanced monitoring and fertility protocols tailored to individual needs. Success rates can vary depending on age and underlying fertility issues, but many couples achieve pregnancy within 3–6 cycles.
